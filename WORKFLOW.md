# Wedding Site Development Workflow

This document explains how to preview and publish changes to your wedding website using Claude Code.

## Overview

You have two environments:
- **Preview Branch** (`preview`) - For testing changes before they go live
- **Main Branch** (`main`) - Your live website at kathyandben.com

## The Workflow (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Make Changes on Preview Branch
When you ask Claude Code to make changes to your site, Claude will:
- Work on the preview branch
- Make the changes you requested
- Commit and push to GitHub

### Step 2: Preview the Changes
After Claude pushes changes:
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/lorenzosoyle/WeddingSite`
2. Look for the preview branch in the branches list
3. Check Vercel for the preview deployment URL
   - OR go to Vercel â†’ Your Project â†’ Deployments
   - Find the deployment for branch `preview`
   - Click the preview URL to see your changes

**Your preview URL will look like:**
`https://wedding-site-git-preview-[your-username].vercel.app`

### Step 3: Publish to Live Site (When You're Happy)
Once you've previewed and like the changes:

**Option A: Using GitHub (Easiest)**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/lorenzosoyle/WeddingSite`
2. Click "Pull requests"
3. Create a new PR from `preview` â†’ `main`
4. Click "Merge pull request"
5. Your live site updates automatically!

**Option B: Ask Claude**
Just say: "Push these changes to the live site" and Claude will create the PR for you to approve.

## Vercel Configuration

To ensure preview deployments work automatically:

1. Go to Vercel â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings
2. Click "Git" in the sidebar
3. Make sure preview deployments are enabled for all branches
4. Vercel will now automatically deploy every branch you push

## Current Branch Setup

- **Main (Production)**: `main` â†’ kathyandben.com
- **Preview (Testing)**: `preview` â†’ Preview URL from Vercel

## Common Commands (For Reference)

You don't need to run these - Claude Code handles them automatically:

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Switch to preview branch
git checkout preview

# Push changes
git push origin preview
```

## Tips

- **Always test on preview first** before merging to main
- **Check the Vercel preview URL** after Claude pushes changes
- **Merge to main only when you're happy** with how it looks
- **Your live site stays safe** until you explicitly merge

## Need Help?

Just ask Claude Code:
- "Show me the preview of my changes"
- "Push this to the live site"
- "What changes did you make?"
- "Create a new feature on the preview branch"

Happy building! ðŸŽ‰
